This project was to see the net approval rating of the current USA President Joe Biden as he came to office January 21, 2021.  

First we must import approval polls data directly off fivethirtyeight website.

```{r}
approval_polllist <- read_csv('https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/biden-approval-data/approval_polllist.csv') 

glimpse(approval_polllist)
```
 We used `lubridate` to fix dates, as they are given as characters.
```{r}
library(lubridate)

updated_approval_polllist <- approval_polllist %>% 
  mutate(modeldate = mdy(paste(as.character(modeldate))),
         startdate = mdy(paste(as.character(startdate))),
         enddate= mdy(paste(as.character(enddate))),
         createddate= mdy(paste(as.character(createddate))),
         week= isoweek(enddate))

updated_approval_polllist
```
We now will get the net approval rate of each week along with some statistics like mean and median. 

We must get the points to plot on our graph. 


```{r}
new_approval_polllist <- updated_approval_polllist  %>% 
  mutate(net_approval_rate = approve - disapprove)  %>% 
  group_by(week)  %>% 
  summarise(average_net_approval_rate = mean(net_approval_rate),
            median_rate = median(net_approval_rate),
            sd_rate = sd(net_approval_rate),
            count = n(),
            t_critical = qt(0.975, count - 1),
            se_rate = sd_rate/sqrt(count),
            margin_of_error = t_critical * se_rate,
            CI_rate_low = average_net_approval_rate - margin_of_error,
            CI_rate_high = average_net_approval_rate + margin_of_error) 

head(new_approval_polllist)
```
Here we are plotting the data so that we can visualize our results.

We are able to see that in Joe Biden's first few weeks he had a net approval rating of +20. As time went on, Joe Biden's net approval ratings have plummeted to -10.

```{r}
ggplot(new_approval_polllist, aes(x = week, y = average_net_approval_rate)) +
  geom_point(color = "orange", size = 0.6) +
  geom_smooth(color = "blue", size = 0.6, se = FALSE) +
  geom_line(color = "orange", size = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = CI_rate_high), color = "orange", size = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = CI_rate_low), color = "orange", size = 0.3) +
  geom_line(aes(y = 0), color = "orange", size = 1) +
  scale_color_grey(aes(ymin = CI_rate_low, ymax = CI_rate_high)) +
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin = CI_rate_low, ymax = CI_rate_high), alpha = 1/10) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs( y = "Average Approval Margin",
        x = "Week of the Year",
        title = "Estimating Approval Margin for Joe Biden",
        subtitle = "Weekly average of all polls") 
```
