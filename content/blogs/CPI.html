<p>In this assignment, we analyzed the year over year change of the US Consumer Price Index (CPI) and compared it to different categories in the economy from January 2000 to August 2021.</p>
<p>From the data we only graphed major categories (Housing, Transportation, Food and beverages, Medical care, Education and communication, Recreation, and Apparel).</p>
<p>To help interpret the graph, we will look at the graph of ‘All Items’. We see that the trend line is relatively stable and sits slightly above 0%. This means from January 2000, to August 2021, the US has seen steady inflation on all items of about 4%.</p>
