I currently attend the London Business School, and I am enrolled in the Masters in Financial Analysis program. The classes here are difficult but I am glad I am learning new things. I have a passion for finance and even studied it during my undergraduate degree. On May 20, 2021, I graduated from the University of Tampa with a 3.74 GPA. I placed in the top 15% of my class and admitted into the Business Honors Society. I came across many interesting subjects, but I believe my most challenging classes were Intermediate Macroeconomics,  and Financial Institutions.
