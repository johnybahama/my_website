I have had work experience in a number of different industries including equity research, consulting, and sales. My resume outlines where, when, and for who I worked for over the course of my career. I have developed hard skills such as creating discounted cash-flow models and researching companies. I also gained soft skills which include delivering presentations, working within a team, and discipline.
