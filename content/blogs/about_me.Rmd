title: Life of Jonathan
---

My name is Jonathan Antor and I am from the beautiful islands of The Bahamas. I am the youngest of 3 children, but luckily I am the favorite child. Among other things, I love to listen to music, watch movies, and hangout with my family and friends. 

I have played sports my whole life and even represented the Bahamas U-17 National Soccer Team in the World Cup Qualifiers. I was proud to represent my country and one day I would like to represent our Men's National team as well. 

A fun fact about me is that I know how to play the piano and one day want to learn how to play "Flight of a Bumble-Bee"
