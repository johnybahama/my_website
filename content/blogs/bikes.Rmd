Our goal is to see if Transport for London (TFL) has a surplus or shortage of bikes to be rented, and if so when do they have this. 

Recall the TfL data on how many bikes were hired every single day. We can get the latest data by running the following:


``` {r}
url <- "https://data.london.gov.uk/download/number-bicycle-hires/ac29363e-e0cb-47cc-a97a-e216d900a6b0/tfl-daily-cycle-hires.xlsx"

# Download TFL data to temporary file
httr::GET(url, write_disk(bike.temp <- tempfile(fileext = ".xlsx")))
```

``` {r}
bike0 <- read_excel(bike.temp,
                   sheet = "Data",
                   range = cell_cols("A:B"))
```
Cleaning the data.

``` {r}
bike <- bike0 %>% 
  clean_names() %>% 
  rename (bikes_hired = number_of_bicycle_hires) %>% 
  mutate (year = year(day),
          month = lubridate::month(day, label = TRUE),
          week = isoweek(day))
```



``` {r}
head(bike)
```
```{r}

updated_bike <- bike %>% 
  filter (year >2015) %>% 
  group_by(month, year) %>% 
  summarise (actual_mean_rental = mean(bikes_hired))

updated_bike_2016_2019 <- bike %>% 
  filter (year >2015 & year< 2020) %>% 
  group_by (month) %>% 
  summarise (expected_rental = mean(bikes_hired)) #expected rentals per month

final_bike <- left_join(updated_bike, updated_bike_2016_2019) %>% 
  mutate (excess_rentals= actual_mean_rental - expected_rental,
          up= ifelse(actual_mean_rental > expected_rental, actual_mean_rental, 
                     expected_rental),
          down= ifelse(actual_mean_rental < expected_rental, actual_mean_rental, 
                       expected_rental))
final_bike
```
This graph conveys the change in monthly average bike rentals over the years 2016-2021. Let us analyze the 2016 graph. The blue line shows us the average change. The red shadow shows us the actual change and we are able to see the difference between the mean and the actual. The green shadow shows us the expected change. This tells us the amount they expected versus the average used.  


``` {r}
ggplot(final_bike, aes(x=month, y= actual_mean_rental)) +
  geom_line(aes(group=1)) + #actual values
  geom_line(aes(y= expected_rental, group=1), size=0.8, color= "blue") + 
  #expected values
  facet_wrap(vars(year)) +
  theme_bw()+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=expected_rental,ymax=up, group=1),fill="darkseagreen3",
              alpha=0.4)+
  geom_ribbon(aes(ymin=down,ymax=expected_rental, group=1),fill="indianred3",
              alpha=0.4) +
  labs(y = "Bike Rentals",
       title= "Monthly changes in TFL bike rentals",
       subtitle= "Change from monthly average shown in blue and calculated between 2016-2019")
```

``` {r}
bike_change <- bike %>% 
  filter((year >= 2016 & year <= 2020) | (year == 2021 & week <53)) %>%
  group_by(week,year) %>%
  mutate(bikes_each_week = sum(bikes_hired)) %>% #sum up no.of bikes in a week
  
  group_by(week) %>% 
  mutate(average_each_week = median(bikes_each_week), #median bikes in same week 
         excess_rentals_percentage = 
           (bikes_each_week - average_each_week)/average_each_week)
  replace_na(list(
    excess_rentals_percentage = 1
  )) 
```

``` {r}
print.data.frame(head(bike_change))
```

The second graph looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52). 

This data is useful because we can see how real world circumstances affects our data. For example, let us look at the graph for 2020. We see a steep decline in rentals from week 12-20. This can be explained by the lock-downs imposed by the UK Government due to the pandemic.

``` {r}
ggplot(bike_change, aes(x = week, y = excess_rentals_percentage))+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 53, by = 13)) +

              fill="darkseagreen3", alpha=0.5) +
  
  geom_rug(data = subset(bike_change, excess_rentals_percentage < 0 ), 
           color="indianred3", sides="b") +
  geom_rug(data = subset(bike_change, excess_rentals_percentage >= 0 ), 
           color="darkseagreen3", sides="b") +
