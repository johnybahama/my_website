We can easily create a facet grid that plots bikes hired by month and year.



Considering the May & June data, standard deviation of 2020 data seems higher compared to other years, because the lines of 2020 May & June data are flatter compared to other years. So, in all years except 2020, around 40k bikes were rented in average both in May & June. However, in 2020 data is not concentrated around the mean. The reason might be, of course, the Covid-19. So, due to the pandemic, we probably do not have enough data to drive meaningful statistics for bike rentals in May & June 2020, thatâ€™s why standard deviation for 2020 May & June data seems higher.

We will now move on to reproducing the following two graphs.



The second one looks at percentage changes from the expected level of weekly rentals. The two grey shaded rectangles correspond to Q2 (weeks 14-26) and Q4 (weeks 40-52).



For both of these graphs, you have calculated the expected number of rentals per week or month between 2016-2019 and then, see how each week/month of 2020-2021 compares to the expected rentals, using the calculation excess_rentals = actual_rentals - expected_rentals.

The mean should be used to calculate the expected rentals per month.

It is likely that the number of rentals on weekdays and weekends will vary by a lot , and the mean is able to take into account all values in the week. This gives a more accurate idea of the average number of rentals in the overall month. On the other hand, the median will only take the middle value in the data-set within the week. This is likely to be a weekday, since there are 5 weekdays in a week and 2 weekends. Median thus does not reflect the average rentals per month accurately.
